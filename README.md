### PHP Shell
This shell is a very stealthy shell concieved by IoTh1nkN0t.

It uses a very clever way of concealing itself by morphing with the existing content, and by only revealing itself to a custom user agent. Plans in the future may include more stealthy transports, or more stealthy activation methods like custom referrers.

Right now the user agent string depends on "Haxor" to be accessible
